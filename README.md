This repo is a tutorial that implements anomaly detection for a temperature sensor. The sensor receives temperature readings and detmerines when a reading is anomolous. In this tutorial you will dive deeper into using automations within a Verilog module.

## Setup
To setup the tutorial, follows these steps: 
1) Fork this repo, **make sure to uncheck main branch only** 
2) Launch the repo in a codespace, wait for the codespace to finish building and extensions finish installing
3) Click the Arctic Fox silhouette on the left, click Activate Arctic Fox on the bottom of the Arctic Fox panel, and enter your Arctic Fox email and password, press Activate (enter not yet supported...) 

## Steps
The tutorial contains the following steps in the following files: 
- Verilog/TemperatureAnomaly.v
  - Steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Verilog/TemperatureAnomalyTest.v 
  - Step 9

You can run the result in a Verilog simulator.
